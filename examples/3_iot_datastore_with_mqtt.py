r"""An example of using TinyFlux as an IOT datastore for MQTT messages.

To test this script, you must be able to publish to the test Mosquitto MQTT
broker, which is a free broker running at test.mosquitto.org.

Port 1883 is unencrypted and unauthenticated, so it should only be used for
test purposes.

This script listens for messages being published to one topic on this broker.

To download a Linux MQTT command line client to publish messages, use brew:

    $ brew install mosquitto

In one terminal window/process, start this script:

    $ python 3_iot_datastore_with_mqtt.py

You should see "Connecting to test.mosquitto.org... success.".

In a second terminal window/process, copy and paste the following, which
publishes a sample JSON encoded message to the test MQTT broker:

    $ mosquitto_pub \
        -h test.mosquitto.org \
        -t tinyflux_test_topic \
        -m "{\"device\":\"thermostat\",\"temperature\":70.0,\"humidity\":0.25}"

This multi-threaded approach to logging MQTT messages comes from Steve Cope's
"Logging MQTT Sensor Data to SQLite DataBase With Python", available at
http://www.steves-internet-guide.com.
