TinyFlux is the tiny time series database optimized for your happiness ðŸ˜Ž

TinyFlux is the time series version of `TinyDB <https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ that is written in Python and has no external dependencies.  It's a great companion for small analytics workflows and apps, as well as at-home IOT data stores.  TinyFlux has 100% test coverage, over 120,000 downloads, and no open issues.

Installation
************

TinyFlux is hosted at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tinyflux/>`__ and is easily downloadable with ``pip``. TinyFlux has been tested with Python 3.8 - 3.13 and PyPy-3.9 on Linux and Windows platforms.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install tinyflux


Introduction
************

TinyFlux is:

- **optimized for your happiness:** TinyFlux is designed to be simple and fun to use by providing a clean API that can be learned in about 90 seconds.

- **time-centric:** Python datetime objects are first-class citizens, and both the storage and queries are optimized for time above all else.

- **human-friendly:** The primary datastore is a CSV, making your database human-readable from the very first write. No need to use SQL to investigate your data, just open the DB file in any tabular-friendly application.

- **pure Python:** TinyFlux needs neither an external server nor any dependencies.

- **tiny:** TinyFlux is about 150kb, unzipped. The current source code has 4,000 lines of code (with about 50% documentation) and 4,000 lines of tests.  

- **developed for modern Python:** TinyFlux works on all modern versions of Python (3.8 - 3.13) and PyPy (3.9).

- **100% covered by tests:** No explanation needed.

To get started, head over to the `TinyFlux docs <https://tinyflux.readthedocs.io/>`__.  Examples can be found in the `examples directory <https://github.com/citrusvanilla/tinyflux/tree/master/examples>`__.  You can also discuss topics related to TinyFlux including general development, extensions, or showcase your TinyFlux-based projects on the `GitHub discussion forum <https://github.com/citrusvanilla/tinyflux/discussions>`__.


Example Code Snippets
*********************

Writing to TinyFlux
===================

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from datetime import datetime, timezone
    >>> from tinyflux import TinyFlux, Point

    >>> db = TinyFlux('/path/to/db.csv')

    >>> p = Point(
    ...     time=datetime(2022, 5, 1, 16, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    ...     tags={"room": "bedroom"},
    ...     fields={"temp": 72.0}
    ... )
    >>> db.insert(p, compact_key_prefixes=True)


Querying TinyFlux
=================

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from tinyflux import FieldQuery, TagQuery, TimeQuery

    >>> # Search for a tag value.
    >>> Tag = TagQuery()
    >>> db.search(Tag.room == 'bedroom')
    [Point(time=2022-05-01T16:00:00+00:00, measurement=_default, tags=room:bedroom, fields=temp:72.0)]

    >>> # Search for a field value.
    >>> Field = FieldQuery()
    >>> db.select("tag.room", Field.temp > 60.0)
    ["bedroom"]

    >>> # Search for a time value.
    >>> Time = TimeQuery()
    >>> time_start = Time >= datetime(2019, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    >>> time_end = Time < datetime(2023, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    >>> db.count(time_start & time_end)
    1
