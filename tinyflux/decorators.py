"""
This module contains decorators for various operations related to \
storage management.

The decorators ensure certain preconditions are met before executing methods,
such as checking if the storage is appendable, readable, or writable. They also
handle temporary storage initialization and cleanup when required.

Decorators included:
- `append_op`: Ensures storage can be appended to before executing the method.
- `read_op`: Ensures storage can be read from, with optional reindexing.
- `temp_storage_op`: Handles temporary storage initialization and cleanup for
  operations.
- `write_op`: Ensures storage can be written to before executing the method.
